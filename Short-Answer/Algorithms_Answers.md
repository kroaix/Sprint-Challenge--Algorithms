## Exercise I

a) The runtime complexity of this code snippet is O(n).
This runs linearly. Say for example n=2.. this will have to run twice.
If n=4 it would have to run 4 times. That is why it is O(n).

b) The runtime complexity of this code snippet is O(n log n).
The for loop is O(n) but then it has a while loop within it, 
which is doubling the value of j and incrementing the value of 
sum for each iteration until it reaches the value of n.

c) The runtime complexity of this code snippet is O(n).
In this recursive function, the amount of times it runs is dependent
of how many bunnies there are. It is taking the number of bunnies and 
subtracting 1 until we get to zero which is a linear decrementing iteration.
